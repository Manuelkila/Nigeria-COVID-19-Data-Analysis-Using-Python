# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
A project for the Ustacky's Data Scientist Microdegree
## Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, statewide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

In this project, we will employ data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.

## Data Sources
- [The Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC)](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/)  
  monitors the countryâ€™s COVID-19 situation, and releases data on metrics across all the 37 states (including FCT) in the country.
- [The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)  
  publishes daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries.
- Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data  
   The vulnerability index was computed by considering several factors such as socioeconomic status, population density, housing type, transportation, epidemiological, health system
- Real Domestic Gross Product Data
- State Budget Data
## Data collection
-[NCDC website](https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/) was scraped using the python library called BeautifulSoup.
- [John Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) Data were imported from their GitHub repository
- Vulnerability index data, Budget data and GDP data were made available locally by the Ustacky Team.
## Analysis
- Details of the analysis can be found in the analysis notebook in this repository. 
- Detailed executive summary can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AELWdkS5y-0Q73pzTjwfzX1OkXVpTTKRsuDQVMLqclY/edit?usp=sharing).
